After being fascinated by the results that a machine can reach that pass the expectations of human-logical thinking (way before ChatGPT), I became interested in machine learning. After studying introductory-related courses in my senior year at the university, I decided to be a machine learning engineer. 

After graduation, I worked as a game developer. Meanwhile, I earned three professional certifications in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Deep Learning from Udacity, Google, and Deep Learning.AI respectively. As a result, I became more proficient in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, neural network architectures (RNN, CNN), error analysis, and the machine learning pipeline. In addition, I learned Python along with its different libraries used for implementing models, including TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy. I utilized these skills to implement a model to classify the donors who can donate with more than 50K with an accuracy of 87.08% and an F-score of 75.31%.
